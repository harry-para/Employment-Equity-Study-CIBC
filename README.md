# Employment Equity Study - CIBC Bank
This project used self reported data from CIBC bank that was sourced from ESDC (Employment and Social Development Canada). 
The data was national data from 2017.
Data Source: https://equity.esdc.gc.ca/sgiemt-weims/pub/f.4rm2@-eng.jsp?eid=281&cal=2017&id=1

The purpose of this project was to observe female representation among senior occupational groups at CIBC.
This project:
 1. Analyzed the connection between gender and other employee statuses (i.e. Indigenous background and disability status) and how this impacted employees achieving specific salary quartiles within various senior level occupational groups.
 2. Produced an intersectional analysis to study competition among women to achieve various salary quartiles by observing how gender coupled with Indigenous background or disability status impacted earnings potential.

This labour analysis was using exploratory data analysis and ordinal logistic regression modeling to predict salary quartile achievement using the R programming language.
Using a training and testing data split, different versions of the regression models were created and assessed for performance.
The model with the best relative performance was used to create visualizations to show joint effects of gender and Indigenous/disability status.

This analysis uses the R programming libraries (i.e. ggplot2) to showcase advanced skills in data manipulation and visualization. 


This analysis used Microsoft Excel to store the datasets that were used to produce data visualizations on Tableau.

The R script and output using Jupyter Notebooks via the RStudio editor is attached above as "CIBC FT Employee Analysis.ipynb".
